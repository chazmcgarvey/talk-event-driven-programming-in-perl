Event-driven programming in Perl
Charles McGarvey | Mon, 6/18 at 2:00 pm | 50 minutes | Ballroom B

Event-driven programming is a paradigm where programmers creates subroutines
that get called when events occur. Events can be just about anything: timers
expiring, new data becoming available to read from a socket, even humans
clicking on things in an interactive program.

Event-driven programming definitely isn't anything new, but there have been
some interesting developments over the past ten years. Event-driven frameworks
and applications have risen in popularity and are replacing systems built
using outdated techniques. New methods and language features have been created
to make event-driven programming nicer.

In this talk weâ€™ll go over:

 - the language features in Perl that make event-driven programming happen,
 - some CPAN modules that offer the extra functionality you need.

This talk is somewhat geared toward beginners (either to Perl or to
event-driven programming), but it may also be interesting to anyone wondering
about the current state of event-driven programming in Perl.
